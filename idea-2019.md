# GSoC 2019 Ideas
A list of ideas we have planned for GSoC 2019 projects.
If you have any ideas which can be useful to us, but are not in the
list, we would love to hear from you.  You need not be a potential
student or a mentor to suggest ideas.

## Criteria for Ideas
1. It should be helpful for community.
2. It does't involve any other landing page, app or software.
3. Do we have a developer/Mentor _now_ who would be willing and able to do it
   if a student was not available, and who can _promise_ to do it if a
   student is not selected.
4. You can add on any other implementation in our idea list which is missing or necessary.

## Hand Gesture Assistant
**Priority:** High

**Prerequisites**<br>
 - Strong Experience with OpenCV and CNN.
 - Experience with Keras.
 - Experience with Python.

**Description**<br>
Main objective is to build hand gesture assistant. People can convey their expression or statement via the gesture software tool.   
Just like a smart phone keypad is able to guess the whole world just by typing a single letter. Our tool will function the same way.
We are combining these resultant gestures and Google Assistant for certain action. <br>
Here is the prototype what we are thinking !

**Note:** Our tool would be also beneficial for the Mute Community. They can convey their expression and statement through hand gesture assistant.

**Project Task Checklist**<br> 
 - Hand gesture assistant would intelligently sense alphabet, words and even sentences by the mean of gestures.
 - Once the human gesture is over then resultant word (In the form of text) should be converted into text and speech.
 - Speech should be compatible in different languages.
 - Combine text and google assistant for taking action.

## P2P Emergency network system

**Prerequisites**<br>
- Hands on experience with Android/Kotlin
- Experience with cloud services

**Description**<br>
In places of natural calamaties such as floods and earthquakes, cellular connectivity is lost. This isolates the surviviors from the world, thus making their rescue and extraction very difficult. So, the proposal is to create a mesh network which can be used to ttransmit current location of the person along with his requirements.
The copy of information will be with every node in the network, and the first device in the network to get internet connectivity will push the information on a cloud service, so that army can initiate the extraction, knowing every information beforehand.

**Project Task Checklist**<br>
- Android App to create a mesh and info filling form
- Distributed ledger system to share on all nodes
- Automatically detect internet connectivity and push the ledger on the cloud service.
